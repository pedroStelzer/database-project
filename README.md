# üçΩÔ∏è Restaurant Delivery Database Project

This project is an academic exercise that simulates a real-world relational database system for a restaurant's delivery service. It involves the complete cycle of database design, implementation, data population, querying, and integration with a Python program.

The main goal is to model and manage data related to restaurant staff, customers, food orders, deliveries, and transportation. The system includes roles like managers, attendants, cooks, delivery personnel (both employees and third-party), and vehicle tracking.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### üß™ Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

#### 2. Start the PostgreSQL and pgAdmin containers

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> This will start:
>
> - A PostgreSQL container with your database
> - A pgAdmin container accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### 3. Install the Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Execute the application

```bash
python app/main.py
```

The script will:

1. Connect to the PostgreSQL container using the credentials from `.env`.
2. Run `create.sql` to create the tables (if not already created).
3. Run `insert.sql` to populate the tables.
4. Execute all SELECT queries in `queries.sql` and print formatted results.
5. Ask whether you want to delete the tables using `delete.sql`.

## üîê Environment Variables

All connection parameters are stored in a `.env` file:

```env
DB_NAME=meubanco
DB_USER=meuusuario
DB_PASSWORD=minhasenha
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5440
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Since this setup is for local testing only, the `.env` file is visible in the project.

## üß† Accessing pgAdmin (optional)

You can access the database visually via pgAdmin:

- URL: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Email: `admin@admin.com`
- Password: `admin123`

After logging in, add a new server manually:

- **Name**: `local`
- **Host**: `db`
- **Port**: `5432`
- **Username**: `meuusuario`
- **Password**: `minhasenha`

> The hostname is `db` because it matches the service name in `docker-compose.yml`.

---

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- PostgreSQL (relational database)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- pgAdmin 4 (web-based database admin tool)
- Python (automation and integration)
  - `psycopg2-binary`
  - `python-dotenv`
  - `tabulate`

---

## üìà Example Queries Output

When running `main.py`, you will see outputs like:

```
üîç Consulta 3:

SELECT nome, telefone FROM Cliente ORDER BY nome;

+------------+--------------+
| nome       | telefone     |
+============+==============+
| Jo√£o       | 81999887766  |
| Maria      | 81998765432  |
| Pedro      | 81991234567  |
+------------+--------------+
```

---

## üßº Resetting the Database

After running queries, the script will ask if you'd like to delete all the tables using `delete.sql`. This is helpful during development or testing to reset the database state.

```bash
Deseja deletar as tabelas? (s/n):
```
